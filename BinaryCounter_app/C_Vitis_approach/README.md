## Binary Counter - C Approach 

In this approach of binary counter PL and PS parts were designed in Xilinx Vivado and then PS part was programmed in Xilinx Vitis.

Scheme designed in Vivado is depicted below:
![vivado_model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc3a2e5-9cf5-4cff-b835-cda31bc85b40)
External buttons and LED's are visible by the names of leds_8bits and btns_5bit and are connected vioa axi_gpio_0 block to Zynq7000 PS. The rest was autogenerated.

* xparameters.h - file that contains created wiht the use of Vivado most vital addresses.
* main.c - file that conatins source code.

The main aim of this simple application was to learn how to develop an application os PS part with the use of PL and to compare it with VHDL approach.
Perypherals used in this project are:
* GPIO (Buttons and LEDs)
* Timers (Hardware timers, but I also tried the ScuTimer, but it is not visible in this project)
* Scugic (Interrupts were used to maintain button inputs and timers' overflow)

Debouncing of a button was designed with the use of simple bitshifting, similar to the vhdl approach. I have tried different approaches (simple delays (just for the sake of experimenting with different approaches, normally it should not be implemented like this.) and another timer waiting for some constant amount of time) yet this one was the most effective.
