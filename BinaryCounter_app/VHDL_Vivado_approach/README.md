## Binary Counter

In this approach of binary counter an application is created and tested in Xilinx Vivado. After testing via behavioural simulation application will be tested on physical board (in my case Zed Board).

* main.vhd contains VHDL source code used to develop binary counter.
* TBD - test file will contain code used for behavioural simulation.
